# Neural Net Practice

Using the deep belief NN implementation at [Deep Learning repository](https://github.com/yusugomori/DeepLearning/tree/master/python)

Tutorials:
* [Lisa Lab Repository](https://github.com/lisa-lab/DeepLearningTutorials)
* [Deep Learning](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/)


Note:
To get it to work, needed to add __init__.py files in DeepLearning and python folders so the files can import.
